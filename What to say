My name is Glenn Lloyd Fletcher.  I am 75.  My birthday was six days ago, the 28th of July.  I was born in Spar-
row Hospital, Lansing Michigan, in 1942.

My name at birth was Glenn Lloyd Alden.  My mother, Lorna June Raymond, was born into a very poor family in
Mason, Michigan.  Mason is quite small.  It is about ten miles from Lansing.  She had 11 brothers and sisters.

I don't know how it came about, but Lorna went to live with a wealthy banking family, the Darts, in Mason.  Per-
haps she was 12.  They were to see to her basic needs and send her to school.  She was to work in the household.
Both parties fulfilled their obligations.  It was was a positive development in her life.  She was no longer a 
dirty, unsupervised, street urchin.  She learned cleanliness and discipline.  Lorna always spoke highly of the 
Darts.  They were good to her.  had married Floyd Alden.  Floyd was a fire-
man, so he had not been drafted to serve in the Second World War.  
I believe that Floyd and Lorna had met through 
their common interest in motorcycles.  I am guessing that they were both members of the local motorcycle club.

Floyd's contribution to the war effort was being a fireman.  Lorna went to work in a factory which produced mili-
tary vehicles.  She was in a team, all women I believe, who dismantled, to some extent,  newly produced jeeps.
They packed them into wooden crates for shipment overseas.

Lorna and Floyd devoloped a serious disagreement about finances.  For example, I remember being told by my mother 
that he Floyd refused to buy a new matress for my baby-bed although the one I had was infested with worms.  They
were unable to reconcile their differences.  Lorna filed for and was granted a divorce in 1946. I was four.  The 
court granted Floyd the right to see me, perhaps take me to the zoo for example, once a month for 12 months.  I 
vaguely remember him doing that, but was it 12 times?  I never saw him after that.
